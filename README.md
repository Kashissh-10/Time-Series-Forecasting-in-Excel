# Time-Series-Forecasting-in-Excel

# Objective: 
Develop a forecasting model to predict monthly car sales using time series analysis and regression modeling in Microsoft Excel.

# Tools & Techniques:
- **Microsoft Excel** (Data Analysis Toolpak, Forecast Sheet, formulas)
- **Time Series Decomposition** (Trend, Seasonality, Residuals)
- **Regression Analysis** (Linear Regression)
- **Moving Averages & Exponential Smoothing**
- **Error Metrics**: MAPE, RMSE, R²

  # Methodology:

- **Data Preparation**: Imported and cleaned multi-year car sales data. Handled missing values and structured the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualized trends, seasonality, and anomalies using line charts and decomposition methods.
- **Regression Modeling**: Built linear and multiple regression models to analyze relationships between sales and external variables (e.g., fuel prices, GDP growth).
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Applied exponential smoothing and Excel’s built-in Forecast Sheet to generate short-term forecasts.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Compared models using MAPE and RMSE to assess forecast accuracy.
- **Visualization & Reporting:** Designed interactive dashboards to communicate insights and compare actual vs. forecasted data.

# Outcome:
The final model accurately captured seasonal sales cycles and provided reliable forecasts for the upcoming quarters. Regression analysis revealed key drivers influencing car sales, enabling more strategic planning.

# Skills Demonstrated:
- Time Series Forecasting
- Excel Modeling
- Regression Analysis
